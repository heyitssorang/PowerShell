Notes

    The user account that runs the script will need local administrative privileges
    on the Hyper-V host

    An "Exclude" job does not allow you to set special-case conditions on VMs.
    They will all follow the job defaults.

    Running the export script without a job name will export all VMs using the
    default conditions.

    The export job has no screen output except to notify you that it has no
    screen output. It writes to the log file as specified in the configurator.

    The export script does not clean up the log file. Ever. The configurator
    tool has an option to clear it. You can also open the log file in a text
    editor, empty it, and save it.

    If the export script is told to export to a location that already contains
    an export of that VM, the existing export is simply deleted.

Setup

    Copy the contents to a permanent location on a Hyper-V host

    Enable .Net Framework and Powershell if not already
    DISM /Online /Enable-Features /FeatureName:NetFx2-ServerCore
    /FeatureName:MicrosoftWindowsPowerShell
    /FeatureName:NetFx2-ServerCore-WOW64

    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

    Change permissions on that share and set the permissions 
    for the computer accounts. "Change" is sufficient on the share 
    and "Modify" is enough for NTFS.

Usage

    On the server, use the command prompt and navigate to the folder where you
    placed the scripts

    POWERSHELL .\Configure-VM-Export.ps1"

    POWERSHELL .\Export-VMs [-JobName] [-Subfolder]

Scheduled Tasks
    "Start a program": 
    Program:  POWERSHELL.exe
    Argument: "C:\Scripts\Export-VMs.ps1" "JobName" "FolderName"

    The job must be set to run with highest privileges and an account that fits
    those listed under "Necessary Privileges".
